# Exercise 10.1

1. Of the encryption algorithms provided by .NET, which is the best choice for symmetric encryption?

AES.

2. Of the encryption algorithms provided by .NET, which is the best choice for asymmetric encryption?

RSA

3. What is a rainbow attack?

Looking up pre-computed hashes in large tables to find the original password.

4. For encryption algorithms, is it better to have a larger or smaller block size?

Larger block size is better because there is a reduced chance of duplicate blocks.

5. What is a hash?

A one way encryption.

6. What is a signature?

A collection of data signed with the private key.

7. What is the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption?

Symmetric uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt while asymmetric uses a pair of public and private keys to encrypt decrypt.

8. What does RSA stand for?

Rivest Shamit Adleman.

9. Why should passwords be salted before being stored?

To prevent duplicate passwords being stored with the same hash.

10. SHA1 is a hashing algorithm designed by the United States National Security Agency. Why should you never use it?

The hashes can be easily cracked with modern hardware.
